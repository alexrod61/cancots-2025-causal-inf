# Course Outline {#sec-course-outline}

## High-Level Course Goals

We used Bloomâ€™s taxonomy (cognitive skills are within brackets):

- Translate a causal research question in terms of the causal roadmap (COMPREHENSION).
- Apply suitable statistical estimation procedures to perform causal inference (APPLICATION).
- Analyze a causal research question using the causal roadmap (ANALYSIS).
- Evaluate publicly available causal study conclusions based on the causal roadmap (EVALUATION).

## Prerequisites

### Mandatory

- Second-year level statistical inference course: Basic notions of hypothesis testing and confidence interval, along with basic frequentist tests (z-test, t-test, Chi-squared test). Something ideal to have as a prerequisite: notions on simulation-based techniques such as bootstrapping and permutation tests.
- Third-year level regression course: Basic ordinary least-squares (OLS) and binary logistic regression.
- Third-year (or second-year) level probability course: Basic notions of probability (independence and conditional probability) along with random variables (measures of central tendency and dispersion) and fundamental distributions (discrete and continuous).

### Co-requisite
Fourth-year level course in experimental design: Basic notions on experimental design (e.g., RCT).

## Duration

The course is planned to be taught over the course of thirteen weeks (2 sessions per week with 1.5 hours as duration).
