This section of the final deliverable presents a concise thirteen-week lesson plan for a fourth-year undergraduate course in causal inference. The lesson plan is **limited** in scope due to the following reasons:

- The lesson plan encompasses **comprehensive learning goals** for each lecture throughout the entire term, with **specific action verbs** aligned with the revised **Bloom's taxonomy** [@bloom1956] as defined by @anderson001. This revised taxonomy organizes the six levels of the cognitive domain (related to learning) as follows:

  1. **Remember:** Recall information from long-term memory, including statistical concepts learned in previous courses.
  2. **Understand:** Comprehend the causal inference concepts covered in the classroom.
  3. **Apply:** Implement these causal inference concepts in various practical scenarios.
  4. **Analyze:** Identify parallels and use critical reasoning to establish patterns and connections. For example, this could involve comparing outputs from different strategies applied in the causal models taught in the course.
  5. **Evaluate:** Assess practical ideas based on established criteria and standards. This level may involve evaluating previously published causal studies.
  6. **Create:** Develop new causal studies based on all the knowledge acquired throughout this course.

- Each week consists of two lecture sessions, each lasting one hour and twenty minutes.
- The lesson plan connects each week to one or two of the eight stages outlined in the course roadmap. For reference, you can revisit [the corresponding section of the deliverable](03-course-roadmap.qmd#sec-course-roadmap). This structure is consistent with the previously described [course format](02-course-outline.qmd#sec-course-format).
- In each lecture, we will aim to align the learning goals with specific scholarly content, such as textbooks or academic papers.
- The lesson plan **does not** include detailed instructional components for each lecture, such as time allocation, learning strategies, or in-class activities.
- While we provide the [course assessment structure](02-course-outline.qmd#sec-course-assessment) (i.e., weights for assignments), this lesson plan **does not** elaborate on specific formative and summative assessments.

## A note on weeks 10, 11, 12, and 13!

The final four weeks of the course will not be used to introduce students to additional modeling techniques in causal inference (**as outlined in stages 4 and 5 of the roadmap**) or to discuss general guidelines for interpreting, reporting, and storytelling in causal studies (**as detailed in stages 6, 7, and 8 of the roadmap**). Instead, students are expected to focus on the following major deliverables:

- **Weeks 10 and 11** will be dedicated to a team-based **appraisal presentation** of an already published causal study, utilizing the roadmap covered throughout the course. There will not be a written report; only an oral presentation is required. 
- **Weeks 12 and 13** will focus on a team-based final project where students will conduct **their final causal study** using a provided dataset and following the causal roadmap. Instead of a final oral presentation, a written report will be submitted to replace the in-class final exam.

Therefore, for the above week, there will not be mapped scholarly materials.

# Lecture Breakdown

Below is a weekly breakdown of the learning goals per lecture. Additionally, we provide a brief summary of each learning week and outline the expectations at the end of the respective two lectures.

## Know your research question! (stage 1 in the roadmap)

During **week 1**, the instructor is expected to introduce students to a foundational mindset in causal inference, which will be linked to the [**course's inferential roadmap**](03-course-roadmap.qmd#sec-course-roadmap). The primary goal for this week is to help students develop the skill to distinguish between statistical inquiries involving association or causation in scientific research. Additionally, students will be introduced to the causal roadmap, which consists of eight stages: (1) *research question*, (2) *causal model representing knowledge*, (3) *counterfactuals and causal parameter definition*, (4) *statistical model definition*, (5) *model fitting*, (6) *result interpretation*, (7) *data analysis report*. This roadmap will serve as the main pillar of the course's learning strategy.

Furthermore, students will explore real-world examples to understand that causal inference is not merely an isolated statistical technique for modelling data (such as solely fitting ordinary-least squares or binary logistic regression to a dataset). Instead, it represents a comprehensive thought process about **counterfactual outcomes** (i.e., potential values of $Y$) and **potential treatment interventions** (i.e., potential values of $X$). By the end of this week, students should be able to comprehend the philosophical and practical differences between asking:

> Is $X$ associated with $Y$?

and

> Does $X$ cause $Y$?

Recognizing the statistical difference between the above two statements is crucial across all scientific disciplines in the practice of causal inference. You can check @cummiskey2020 and @lubbke2020 for further elaboration on this matter.

## Using graphical models to depict causality (stage 2 in the roadmap)

During **Week 2**, students will have their first exposure to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). According to the course roadmap, DAGs are graphical models that represent knowledge about causal inquiries, which we are expected to develop in collaboration with subject-matter experts. We will view DAGs as essential tools for visualizing and reasoning about causal relationships.

![Image by [*Manfred Stege*](https://pixabay.com/users/manfredsteger-1848497/) via [*Pixabay*](https://pixabay.com/vectors/pixel-cells-teaching-to-learn-wiki-3976301/).](img/board.png){width="450"}

The week will begin with a formal introduction to **DAG syntax and terminology**. After that, students will engage in hands-on practice constructing DAGs based on real-world scenarios from various scientific fields. Additionally, we will differentiate between **experimental**, **quasi-experimental**, and **observational studies** to demonstrate how DAGs can help identify assumptions in different study designs. By the end of the week, students should understand why DAGs offer valuable insights into causal logic, which will be beneficial for the subsequent stages of the course roadmap.

### Lecture 3

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

1. Explain key components of DAGs, including nodes, directed edges, and acyclic structure (**understand** level).
2. Illustrate how DAGs represent causal assumptions and the concept of d-separation (**understand** level).
3. Compare DAGs derived from experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational designs to assess differences in identifiability (**analyze** level).
4. Construct simple DAGs to represent real-life study scenarios (**analyze** level).

The above goals can be mapped to the following materials:

1. [Chapter 6 (Graphical Representation of Causal Effects)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/675db8b0dd37046447128f5f/t/6835bdb7dc9e482163d8712d/1748352541538/hernanrobins_WhatIf_27may25.pdf) from @hernan2024 and [Chapter 6 (Causal Diagrams)](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-CausalDiagrams.html) from @huntington2021.

  - "*Utilizing Causal Diagrams across Quasi-Experimental Approaches*" by @arif2022.
4. [Chapter 7 (Drawing Causal Diagrams)](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-DrawingCausalDiagrams.html) from @huntington2021. 

### Lecture 4

By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:

1. Create DAGs to represent hypothetical causal mechanisms based on subject-matter expertise (**create level**).
2. Identify common structures in DAGs such as confounding, mediating, backdoor criterion, and colliding paths (**analyze** level),
3. Evaluate the adequacy of DAGs constructed by peers or drawn from published studies, focusing on clarity and underlying assumptions (**evaluate** level).
4. Differentiate between experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational study designs using DAGs to illustrate assumptions and limitations (**understand** level).

The above goals can be mapped to the following materials:

1. To address this goal, the students could have hands-on practice with the cases depicted  by @morgan2007 provide a fair list of referenced examples in **Chapter 1 (Introduction)**, specifically in **sections 1.3.1 (Broad Examples from Sociology, Economics, and Political Science)**.
2. [Chapter 8 (Causal Paths and Closing Back Doors)](https://theeffectbook.net/ch-CausalPaths.html) from @huntington2021, [Chapter 7 (Confounding)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/675db8b0dd37046447128f5f/t/6835bdb7dc9e482163d8712d/1748352541538/hernanrobins_WhatIf_27may25.pdf) from @hernan202, and **Chapter 1 (Causal Graphs, Identification, and Models of Causal Exposure)** from @morgan2007.
3. To address this goal, students are expected to assess the DAGs delivered in goal (1) while applying the concepts addressed in goal (2).
4. The developed material from **lecture 3**, to address the respective **goal (3)**, can be used to fulfil this goal.

## Week 3: Introduction to counterfactuals (STEP 3 in the roadmap)

- This week, we can start using programming to code up simulations for the structural causal model, counterfactuals, and causal parameters.
- We follow these steps:
  1. Define the DAG.
  2. Define a structural causal model based on the DAG.
  3. Define counterfactuals based on the structural causal model.
  4. Define causal parameters based on the counterfactuals.
  5. Relate the causal parameters to the primary research question.

## Week 4: Identifiability conditions

- Ensuring the causal parameter coincides with the statistical parameter, i.e., an identifiability assumption: no unmeasured confounding (coming from the DAG, consult with experts), positivity (probability that every study unit could be in the control or treatment).
- We plan to talk about d-separation and back-door criterion.
- We also plan to discuss different vocabulary in different fields (epidemiology, experimental design, econometrics). For example, SUTVA, etc. It would be useful to have a discussion of what sets of assumptions are equivalent.

## Week 5: G-estimation for causal parameter (STEPS 4 and 5 in the roadmap)

- Focus on ATE, average treatment effect.
- Introduction to G-estimation: parametric and non-parametric.

## Week 6: Inverse probability weights (STEPS 4 and 5 in the roadmap)

- Introduction to inverse probability weights (IPWs): parametric and non-parametric.

## Week 7: Causal mediation analysis (STEPS 4 and 5 in the roadmap)

- Introduction to causal mediation analysis.
- Parametric and non-parametric.

## Week 8: Interpretation and report (STEPS 6 and 7 in the roadmap)

## Week 9: Storytelling (STEP 8 in the roadmap)

## Week 10: Appraisal of causal analysis using the roadmap

- Review an existing causal analysis (i.e., a published research paper) using the causal roadmap covered in class.
- This is a team-based work.

## Week 11: Presentation of appraisals

Team presentations.

## Week 12: Analysis of worked examples while contrasting them with the causal roadmap

- This is a team-based work (using the previous appraisal teams).
- General overview of the final project (first lecture).
- Introduction to the datasets (first lecture).
- Perform a case study, using a dataset not available to students to pick from (it will be the same dataset for all teams), using the causal roadmap (second lecture).

## Week 13: Analysis of worked examples while contrasting them with the causal roadmap (II)

- We will use the last two lectures for in-class group work on the final project (i.e., whose deliverable is a written report).
- Note that there is no final exam in this course.

"*Estimating Causal Effects from Epidemiological Data*" from @hernan2006.
