This section of the final deliverable presents a concise thirteen-week lesson plan for a fourth-year undergraduate course in causal inference. The lesson plan is **limited** in scope due to the following reasons:

- The lesson plan encompasses **comprehensive learning goals** for each lecture throughout the entire term, with **specific action verbs** aligned with the revised **Bloom's taxonomy** [@bloom1956] as defined by @anderson001. This revised taxonomy organizes the six levels of the cognitive domain (related to learning) as follows:

  1. **Remember:** Recall information from long-term memory, including statistical concepts learned in previous courses.
  2. **Understand:** Comprehend the causal inference concepts covered in the classroom.
  3. **Apply:** Implement these causal inference concepts in various practical scenarios.
  4. **Analyze:** Identify parallels and use critical reasoning to establish patterns and connections. For example, this could involve comparing outputs from different strategies applied in the causal models taught in the course.
  5. **Evaluate:** Assess practical ideas based on established criteria and standards. This level may involve evaluating previously published causal studies.
  6. **Create:** Develop new causal studies based on all the knowledge acquired throughout this course.

- Each week consists of two lecture sessions, each lasting one hour and twenty minutes.
- The lesson plan connects each week to one of the eight stages outlined in the course roadmap. For reference, please revisit [the corresponding section of the deliverable](03-course-roadmap.qmd#sec-course-roadmap). This structure is consistent with the previously described [course format](02-course-outline.qmd#sec-course-format).
- In each lecture, we will aim to align the learning goals with specific scholarly content, such as textbooks or academic papers.
- The lesson plan **does not** include detailed instructional components for each lecture, such as time allocation, learning strategies, or in-class activities.
- While we provide the course assessment structure (i.e., weights for assignments), this lesson plan **does not** elaborate on specific formative and summative assessments.

## A note on weeks 10, 11, 12, and 13!

The final four weeks of the course will not be used to introduce students to additional modeling techniques in causal inference (**as outlined in stages 4 and 5 of the roadmap**) or to discuss general guidelines for interpreting, reporting, and storytelling in causal studies (**as detailed in stages 6, 7, and 8 of the roadmap**). Instead, students are expected to focus on the following major deliverables:

- **Weeks 10 and 11** will be dedicated to a team-based **appraisal presentation** of an already published causal study, utilizing the roadmap covered throughout the course. There will not be a written report; only an oral presentation is required. 
- **Weeks 12 and 13** will focus on a team-based final project where students will conduct **their final causal study** using a provided dataset and following the causal roadmap. Instead of a final oral presentation, a written report will be submitted to replace the in-class final exam.

# Lecture Breakdown

## Week 1: Know your research question! (STEP 1 in the roadmap)

- What is causal inference?
- Distinguishing between causal and association research questions.
- High-level overview of the causal roadmap.
- Providing real-life examples of research studies.

## Week 2: Using graphical models to depict causality (STEP 2 in the roadmap)

- Introduction to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
- Begin getting familiar with the DAG concepts so students can start building their own DAGs.
- We will use real-life examples (e.g., research studies) to start exercising the DAG making.
- Differences between experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies

## Week 3: Introduction to counterfactuals (STEP 3 in the roadmap)

- This week, we can start using programming to code up simulations for the structural causal model, counterfactuals, and causal parameters.
- We follow these steps:
  1. Define the DAG.
  2. Define a structural causal model based on the DAG.
  3. Define counterfactuals based on the structural causal model.
  4. Define causal parameters based on the counterfactuals.
  5. Relate the causal parameters to the primary research question.

## Week 4: Identifiability conditions

- Ensuring the causal parameter coincides with the statistical parameter, i.e., an identifiability assumption: no unmeasured confounding (coming from the DAG, consult with experts), positivity (probability that every study unit could be in the control or treatment).
- We plan to talk about d-separation and back-door criterion.
- We also plan to discuss different vocabulary in different fields (epidemiology, experimental design, econometrics). For example, SUTVA, etc. It would be useful to have a discussion of what sets of assumptions are equivalent.

## Week 5: G-estimation for causal parameter (STEPS 4 and 5 in the roadmap)

- Focus on ATE, average treatment effect.
- Introduction to G-estimation: parametric and non-parametric.

## Week 6: Inverse probability weights (STEPS 4 and 5 in the roadmap)

- Introduction to inverse probability weights (IPWs): parametric and non-parametric.

## Week 7: Causal mediation analysis (STEPS 4 and 5 in the roadmap)

- Introduction to causal mediation analysis.
- Parametric and non-parametric.

## Week 8: Interpretation and report (STEPS 6 and 7 in the roadmap)

## Week 9: Storytelling (STEP 8 in the roadmap)

## Week 10: Appraisal of causal analysis using the roadmap

- Review an existing causal analysis (i.e., a published research paper) using the causal roadmap covered in class.
- This is a team-based work.

## Week 11: Presentation of appraisals

Team presentations.

## Week 12: Analysis of worked examples while contrasting them with the causal roadmap

- This is a team-based work (using the previous appraisal teams).
- General overview of the final project (first lecture).
- Introduction to the datasets (first lecture).
- Perform a case study, using a dataset not available to students to pick from (it will be the same dataset for all teams), using the causal roadmap (second lecture).

## Week 13: Analysis of worked examples while contrasting them with the causal roadmap (II)

- We will use the last two lectures for in-class group work on the final project (i.e., whose deliverable is a written report).
- Note that there is no final exam in this course.
