An accessible and contemporary introduction to the methods
for determining cause and effect in the social sciences
Causal inference encompasses the tools that allow social scientists
to determine what causes what. Economists-who generally can't run
controlled experiments to test and validate their hypotheses-apply
these tools to observational data to make connections. In a messy
world, causal inference is what helps establish the causes and
effects of the actions being studied, whether the impact (or lack
thereof) of increases in the minimum wage on employment, the
effects of early childhood education on incarceration later in
life, or the introduction of malaria nets in developing regions on
economic growth. Scott Cunningham introduces students and
practitioners to the methods necessary to arrive at meaningful
answers to the questions of causation, using a range of modeling
techniques and coding instructions for both the R and Stata
programming languages.
