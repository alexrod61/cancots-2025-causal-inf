    "text": "Details of CanCOTS 2025 including this working group\n\n\n\n\nEvent: Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS) 2025.\nHeld by: Statistical Education section of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC).\nDates: Wednesday and Thusday, June 11 and 12, 2025.\nPlace: HEC Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nWorking Group’s Topic: Incorporating Causal Inference in Statistics Courses\nCollaborators: G. Alexi Rodríguez-Arelis (UBC) and Philippe Boileau (McGill University).\n\n\n\n\n1 About This Website\nThis Quarto website contains the final deliverable from one of the working groups of the first edition of the Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS), held in the summer of 2025 at HEC Montréal. CanCOTS is primarily a participant-driven working meeting that follows the format of a curated unconference. In this style of unconference, various working groups focus on priority areas of interest related to educational topics in statistics. All groups are expected to produce concrete deliverables addressing these priority areas, which may include exercise banks, curriculum guidelines, sample learning activities, and assessment items. Each working group has a leader who is responsible for overseeing collaborative efforts and shaping the final deliverable.\n\n\n\nImage by manfredsteger via Pixabay.\n\n\nCanCOTS 2025 began with an initial roundtable discussion that brought all participants together. During this session, each group leader presented their educational topic along with a proposal for the final deliverable. Following these presentations, participants split into smaller working groups based on their interests. During the working group meetings, participants—including the group leaders—discussed and brainstormed ideas to develop the final deliverable. Additionally, a comprehensive list of potential resources was compiled to ensure that the deliverable contains fair and scholarly content.\nCanCOTS 2025 featured six different working groups, each focusing on a specific area of interest. One of these groups prioritized incorporating causal inference into statistics courses. As a result, the final deliverable for this working group was a curriculum guideline for developing a fourth-year undergraduate course in causal inference. At the start of the unconference, the specifics of the final deliverable were outlined as follows:\n\nAn overall course curriculum on causal inference (including lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of course content) with two fundamental pillars: experimentation and quasi-experimentation. A stretch goal of this working group would be incorporating data science-flavored topics such as A/B testing.\n\nNevertheless, during the group meetings, the specifics of the final deliverable were revised to go beyond experimentation and quasi-experimentation to include observational studies. Additionally, the brainstorming sessions focused more on statistical perspectives rather than a data science approach. As a result, the final deliverable included in this repository has the following specifics:\n\nOur final deliverable is an overall fourth-year undergraduate course curriculum on causal inference (including a limited lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of the course) based on a general causal inference roadmap of eight stages: (1) research question, (2) causal model representing knowledge, (3) counterfactuals and causal parameter definition, (4) statistical model definition, (5) model fitting, (6) result interpretation, (7) data analysis report.\n\nThe above causal inference was inspired on one used in the course Introduction to Causal Inference by Petersen and Balzer (2014).\n\n\n2 Rationale of Final Deliverable\n\nCorrelation does not imply causation.\n\nLübke et al. (2020) have indicated that the above mantra can be overcome with the aid of the learning of concepts in causal inference. Yet, as educators in statistics, we have not fully addressed the teaching of these concepts during introductory courses (Cummiskey et al. 2020). Therefore, if we start thin\n\n\n3 Website Overview\n\nIntroductory Slides: These slides were preliminary before shaping them into our final deliverable.\nCourse Outline: A general course outline including course description and rationale, general learning goals, intended student audience, course format, assessment criteria and grading.\nCourse Roadmap: The roadmap including the above eight stages with brief explanations.\nLimited Course Lesson Plan: A limited, structured guide that outlines what will be taught during a specific class session or over a short unit.\n\n\n\n4 License\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCummiskey, Kevin, Bryan Adams, James Pleuss, Dusty Turner, Nicholas Clark, and Krista Watts and. 2020. “Causal Inference in Introductory Statistics Courses.” Journal of Statistics Education 28 (1): 2–8. https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2020.1713936.\n\n\nLübke, Karsten, Matthias Gehrke, Jörg Horst, and Gero Szepannek and. 2020. “Why We Should Teach Causal Inference: Examples in Linear Regression with Simulated Data.” Journal of Statistics Education 28 (2): 133–39. https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2020.1752859.\n\n\nPetersen, Maya, and Laura Balzer. 2014. “Introduction to Causal Inference.” https://ctml.berkeley.edu/introduction-causal-inference."

    "text": "Image by manfredsteger via Pixabay.\n\n\nThis section of the final deliverable presents a concise thirteen-week lesson plan for a fourth-year undergraduate course in causal inference. The lesson plan is limited in scope due to the following reasons:\n\nThe lesson plan encompasses comprehensive learning goals for each lecture throughout the entire term, with specific action verbs aligned with the revised Bloom’s taxonomy (Bloom et al. 1956) as defined by Anderson and Krathwohl (2001). This revised taxonomy organizes the six levels of the cognitive domain (related to learning) as follows:\n\nRemember: Recall information from long-term memory, including statistical concepts learned in previous courses.\nUnderstand: Comprehend the causal inference concepts covered in the classroom.\nApply: Implement these causal inference concepts in various practical scenarios.\nAnalyze: Identify parallels and use critical reasoning to establish patterns and connections. For example, this could involve comparing outputs from different strategies applied in the causal models taught in the course.\nEvaluate: Assess practical ideas based on established criteria and standards. This level may involve evaluating previously published causal studies.\nCreate: Develop new causal studies based on all the knowledge acquired throughout this course.\n\nEach week consists of two lecture sessions, each lasting one hour and twenty minutes.\nThe lesson plan connects each week to one of the eight stages outlined in the course roadmap. For reference, please revisit the corresponding section of the deliverable. This structure is consistent with the previously described course format.\nIn each lecture, we will aim to align the learning goals with specific scholarly content, such as textbooks or academic papers.\nThe lesson plan does not include detailed instructional components for each lecture, such as time allocation, learning strategies, or in-class activities.\nWhile we provide the course assessment structure (i.e., weights for assignments), this lesson plan does not elaborate on specific formative and summative assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA note on weeks 10, 11, 12, and 13!\n\n\n\nThe final four weeks of the course will not be used to introduce students to additional modeling techniques in causal inference (as outlined in stages 4 and 5 of the roadmap) or to discuss general guidelines for interpreting, reporting, and storytelling in causal studies (as detailed in stages 6, 7, and 8 of the roadmap). Instead, students are expected to focus on the following major deliverables:\n\nWeeks 10 and 11 will be dedicated to a team-based appraisal presentation of an already published causal study, utilizing the roadmap covered throughout the course. There will not be a written report; only an oral presentation is required.\nWeeks 12 and 13 will focus on a team-based final project where students will conduct their final causal study using a provided dataset and following the causal roadmap. Instead of a final oral presentation, a written report will be submitted to replace the in-class final exam.",
