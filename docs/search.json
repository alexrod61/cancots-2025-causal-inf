    "text": "Details of CanCOTS 2025 including this working group\n\n\n\n\nEvent: Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS) 2025.\nHeld by: Statistical Education section of the Statistical Society of Canada (SSC).\nDates: Wednesday and Thusday, June 11 and 12, 2025.\nPlace: HEC Montréal, Québec, Canada.\nWorking Group’s Topic: Incorporating Causal Inference in Statistics Courses\nCollaborators: G. Alexi Rodríguez-Arelis (UBC) and Philippe Boileau (McGill University).\n\n\n\n\n1 About This Website\nThis Quarto website contains the final deliverable from one of the working groups of the first edition of the Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS), held in the summer of 2025 at HEC Montréal. CanCOTS is primarily a participant-driven working meeting that follows the format of a curated unconference. In this style of unconference, various working groups focus on priority areas of interest related to educational topics in statistics. All groups are expected to produce concrete deliverables addressing these priority areas, which may include exercise banks, curriculum guidelines, sample learning activities, and assessment items. Each working group has a leader who is responsible for overseeing collaborative efforts and shaping the final deliverable.\n\n\n\nImage by manfredsteger via Pixabay.\n\n\nCanCOTS 2025 began with an initial roundtable discussion that brought all participants together. During this session, each group leader presented their educational topic along with a proposal for the final deliverable. Following these presentations, participants split into smaller working groups based on their interests. During the working group meetings, participants—including the group leaders—discussed and brainstormed ideas to develop the final deliverable. Additionally, a comprehensive list of potential resources was compiled to ensure that the deliverable contains fair and scholarly content.\nCanCOTS 2025 featured six different working groups, each focusing on a specific area of interest. One of these groups prioritized incorporating causal inference into statistics courses. As a result, the final deliverable for this working group was a curriculum guideline for developing a fourth-year undergraduate course in causal inference. At the start of the unconference, the specifics of the final deliverable were outlined as follows:\n\nAn overall course curriculum on causal inference (including lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of course content) with two fundamental pillars: experimentation and quasi-experimentation. A stretch goal of this working group would be incorporating data science-flavored topics such as A/B testing.\n\nNevertheless, during the group meetings, the specifics of the final deliverable were revised to go beyond experimentation and quasi-experimentation to include observational studies. Additionally, the brainstorming sessions focused more on statistical perspectives rather than a data science approach. As a result, the final deliverable included in this repository has the following specifics:\n\nOur final deliverable is an overall fourth-year undergraduate course curriculum on causal inference (including a limited lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of the course) based on a general causal inference roadmap of eight stages: (1) research question, (2) causal model representing knowledge, (3) counterfactuals and causal parameter definition, (4) statistical model definition, (5) model fitting, (6) result interpretation, (7) data analysis report.\n\nThe above causal inference was inspired on one used in the course Introduction to Causal Inference by Petersen and Balzer (2014).\n\n\n2 Website Overview\n\nIntroductory Slides: These slides were preliminary before shaping them into our final deliverable.\nCourse Outline: A general course outline including course rationale, course description, general learning goals, intended student audience, course format, assessment criteria and grading.\nCourse Roadmap: The roadmap including the above eight stages with brief explanations.\nLimited Course Lesson Plan: A limited, structured guide that outlines what will be taught during a specific class session or over a short unit.\n\n\n\n3 License\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nPetersen, Maya, and Laura Balzer. 2014. “Introduction to Causal Inference.” https://ctml.berkeley.edu/introduction-causal-inference."

Familiarity with \\(z\\)-tests, \\(t\\)-tests, and Chi-squared tests would enable students to understand how causal claims are assessed statistically. Exposure to simulation-based methods (such as bootstrapping and permutation tests) will be beneficial, as these resampling techniques help estimate uncertainty when analytic solutions are complex or unavailable.\nSecond or Third-Year Probability Theory: This course would provide a good grasp of probability concepts, including independence, conditional probability, and the properties of random variables. Previous exposure to key probability distributions (e.g., Bernoulli, Binomial, Normal, Exponential) and summary statistics (e.g., means and variances) would support both graphical and potential-outcome-based approaches to causal inference. This background would enable students to reason formally about uncertainty and probabilistic dependencies in causal structures.\nThird-Year Regression Analysis: A solid understanding of ordinary least-squares (OLS) and binary logistic regression would be essential. These skills would allow students to model relationships between variables, which is vital for adjusting confounders or estimating treatment effects. These techniques serve as the analytical foundation for many causal inference methods, including potential outcomes frameworks. A reasonable understanding of modelling assumptions, estimation procedures, and model diagnostics in regression analysis will be expected.",

    "text": "1.1 Know your Research Question! (stage 1 in the roadmap)\nDuring week 1, the instructor is expected to introduce students to a foundational mindset in causal inference, which will be linked to the course’s inferential roadmap. The primary goal for this week is to help students develop the skill to distinguish between statistical inquiries involving association or causation in scientific research. Additionally, students will be introduced to the causal roadmap, which consists of eight stages: (1) research question, (2) causal model representing knowledge, (3) counterfactuals and causal parameter definition, (4) statistical model definition, (5) model fitting, (6) result interpretation, (7) data analysis report. This roadmap will serve as the main pillar of the course’s learning strategy.\n\n\n\nImage by Manfred Stege via Pixabay.\n\n\nFurthermore, students will explore real-world examples to understand that causal inference is not merely an isolated statistical technique for modelling data (such as solely fitting ordinary-least squares or binary logistic regression to a dataset). Instead, it represents a comprehensive thought process about counterfactual outcomes (i.e., potential values of \\(Y\\)) and potential treatment interventions (i.e., potential values of \\(X\\)). By the end of this week, students should be able to comprehend the philosophical and practical differences between asking:\n\nIs \\(X\\) associated with \\(Y\\)?\n\nand\n\nDoes \\(X\\) cause \\(Y\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRecognizing the statistical difference between the above two statements is crucial across all scientific disciplines in the practice of causal inference. You can check Cummiskey et al. (2020) and Lübke et al. (2020) for further elaboration on this matter.\n\n\n\n1.1.1 Lecture 1\nBy the end of this lecture, students should be able to:\n\nDescribe what causal inference is along with its usefulness in scientific research (remember level).\nExplain how causation and association differ via practical examples (understand level).\nClassify different types of research questions in terms causation and association (understand level).\nIdentify the components of a causal questions, e.g., treatment, outcome, and population.\n\nThe above goals can be mapped to the following materials:\n\nChapter 2 (Research Questions) from Huntington-Klein (2021) and Chapter 1 (A definition of causal effect) from Hernán (2024) and Roadmap Overview & Roadmap Step 0 - Research Question (Lecture 1a - Why Bother with Causal Inference?) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nChapter 1 (Correlation, Association, and the Yule-Simpson Paradox) from Ding (2024) and Roadmap Overview & Roadmap Step 0 - Research Question (Lecture 1b - Causal vs. Statistical inference) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nChapter 1 (Introduction - Do Not Confuse Correlation with Causality) from Cunningham (2021) and Roadmap Overview & Roadmap Step 0 - Research Question (Lecture 1c: The Causal Roadmap Steps 0-3) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nChapters 2 (Randomized Experiments) and 3 (Observational Studies) from Hernán (2024) and Chapter 2 (Potential Outcomes) from Ding (2024).\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Lecture 2\nBy the end of this lecture, students should be able to:\n\nExplain the steps of the causal inference roadmap (understand level).\nExamine real-life study descriptions to identify whether they pose a causal or association question (analyze level).\nFormulate well-structured causal questions based on a given observational or experimental context. (create level).\nAssess the validity and clarity of causal questions in peer-reviewed studies (evaluate level).\n\nThe above goals can be mapped to the following materials:\n\nRoadmap Overview & Roadmap Step 0 - Research Question (Lecture 1c - The Causal Roadmap) from Petersen and Balzer (2014). Recall that the roadmap for this course is inspired by this reference. Hence, this material can be used as a baseline to introduce our roadmap.\nFor this learning goal, the instructor could provide a summary of the following four published papers (two of which pose causal questions, whereas the other two pose association questions):\n\n\nCausal questions:\n\n“Does Compulsory School Attendance Affect Schooling and Earnings?” from Angrist and Krueger (1991).\n“Using Geographic Variation in College Proximity to Estimate the Return to Schooling” from Card (1995).\n\nAssociation questions:\n\n“Association of Animal and Plant Protein Intake With All-Cause and Cause-Specific Mortality” from Song et al. (2016).\n“Association between Sleep Duration and Mortality among Adults with Type 2 Diabetes: A Prospective Cohort Study” from Wang et al. (2020).\n\n\n\nRoadmap Overview & Roadmap Step 0 - Research Question (Lecture 1c - The Causal Roadmap) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nMorgan and Winship (2007) provide a fair list of referenced examples in Chapter 1 (Introduction), specifically in sections 1.3.1 (Broad Examples from Sociology, Economics, and Political Science) and 1.3.2 (Narrow and Specific Examples).",

We will view DAGs as essential tools for visualizing and reasoning about causal relationships.\n\n\n\nImage by Manfred Stege via Pixabay.\n\n\nThe week will begin with a formal introduction to DAG syntax and terminology. After that, students will engage in hands-on practice constructing DAGs based on real-world scenarios from various scientific fields. Additionally, we will differentiate between experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational studies to demonstrate how DAGs can help identify assumptions in different study designs.

    "section": "1.3 Introduction to Counterfactuals (stage 3 in the roadmap)",
    "text": "1.3 Introduction to Counterfactuals (stage 3 in the roadmap)\nWeek 3 focuses on both the theoretical and practical aspects of counterfactuals. As outlined in the course roadmap, counterfactuals play a crucial role in the entire causal inference process. They are an essential component of the structural causal model (SCM), which is a mathematical framework for illustrating the causal relationships between variables within a given system. This SCM framework will also provide students with computational tools to connect DAGs, discussed in week 2, with counterfactual reasoning.\nThe workflow for this week begins with defining the DAG in the context of a causal inference inquiry within a specific system. Students will then derive a SCM composed of equations that represent the data-generating process for each variable. These equations explicitly illustrate the mechanisms that produce counterfactual outcomes, such as:\n\nWhat would happen to an outcome \\(Y\\) if treatment \\(X\\) were set to a different value?\n\nThis type of inquiry is essential for formulating and interpreting what we refer to as causal parameters, such as the average treatment effect (ATE).\n\n\n\nImage by Manfred Stege via Pixabay.\n\n\nBy the end of the week, students are expected to learn how to use code-based simulations in R (R Core Team 2024) or Python (Van Rossum and Drake 2009) to apply the logic associated with DAGs, SCMs, and counterfactuals through simple scenarios. They will simulate interventions, explore counterfactuals, and compute causal parameters to address research questions effectively. This process specifically involves examining how potential outcomes arise from different interventions, which allows us to connect our findings back to the DAG and ultimately enables us to produce valid causal claims. It is essential to emphasize to students that our simulated causal parameters must align with the research question(s) established in stage 1 of the roadmap.\n\n1.3.1 Lecture 5\nBy the end of this lecture, students should be able to:\n\nExplain the structure and components of a SCM derived from a DAG (understand level).\nExplain the conceptual link between structural equations and counterfactual outcomes (understand level).\nImplement simple SCMs using code to simulate counterfactual scenarios (apply level).\nClassify the types of causal questions that we can answer from a given SCM and DAG (understand level).\n\nThe above goals can be mapped to the following materials:\n\nChapters 3 (Observational studies) and 5 (Interaction) from Hernán (2024). These chapters offer a comprehensive theoretical content. For in-class material, Roadmap Step 1 - Causal Model (Lecture 2a - Intro to Structural Causal Models), from Petersen and Balzer (2014), is a fair starting point.\nChapter 2 (The Counterfactual Model) from Morgan and Winship (2007); this chapter offers a comprehensive theoretical content. For in-class material, Roadmap Step 1 - Causal Model (Lecture 2b - How SCMs encode causal assumptionss), from Petersen and Balzer (2014), is a fair starting point.\nChapter 4 (Potential Outcomes Causal Model), from Cunningham (2021), provides simple coding examples via R and Python that the instructor could use in their in-class material.\nFor in-class material, Roadmap Step 1 - Causal Model (Lecture 2c - SCMs & Directed Acyclic Graphs), from Petersen and Balzer (2014), is a fair starting point. Moreover, students can continue with the DAGs constructed to address goal (4) from lecture 4 to deliver the corresponding SCMs for the corresponding experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational designs.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Lecture 6\nBy the end of this lecture, students should be able to:\n\nInterpret counterfactual quantities such as \\(Y^a\\), the potential outcome under treatment level \\(a\\) (understand level).\nImplement causal parameters (e.g.; ATE or average treatment effect on the treated, ATT) from simulated SCMs using counterfactual logic (apply level).\nIdentify causal parameters with specific scientific research questions (apply level).\nDesign small simulation exercises to test assumptions underlying counterfactual inference (create level).\n\nThe above goals can be mapped to the following materials:\n\nChapters 3 (Observational studies) and 5 (Interaction) from Hernán (2024). These chapters offer a comprehensive theoretical content.\nThere are two potential sources of material we can use to fulfill this goal:\n\n\nThe first one is less technical and it is Chapter 10 - Treatment Effects from Huntington-Klein (2021). If the instructor chooses to use more technical content during class time, this might be an ideal pre-lecture material.\nThe second one is Chapter 4 (Potential Outcomes Causal Model), from Cunningham (2021). This material is more technical.\n\n\nStudents are expected to fulfill this learning goal by using the SCMs delivered in lecture 5 for its corresponding goal (4).\nStudents are expected to continue working with the SCMs from the above goal (3). Now, it is time to code the SCMs delivered from the corresponding experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational designs.",

    "section": "1.4 Defining the Statistical Model: Observed Data and Identifiability Conditions (stage 4 in the roadmap)",
    "text": "1.4 Defining the Statistical Model: Observed Data and Identifiability Conditions (stage 4 in the roadmap)\nDuring week 4, the instructor is expected to connect the causal model represented by DAGs and SCMs with the corresponding statistical model, with a focus on the identifiability of causal parameters. We start by recalling DAGs as formal representations of causal assumptions. From these DAGs, we construct SCMs, specifying structural equations and endogenous variables that determine counterfactual outcomes. Once the SCM is defined, we analyze how these counterfactuals relate to observed data, emphasizing that only a subset of potential outcomes can be observed.\nA key focus this week is on the spectrum of assumptions in statistical modelling. Parametric models specify a complete probability distribution (for example, ordinary least-squares regression with normally distributed errors), while semi-parametric models relax some of these specifications (like Cox models). Non-parametric models impose minimal assumptions on the functional form, relying solely on the assumptions encoded in the DAG.\n\n\n\nImage by Manfred Stege via Pixabay.\n\n\nIn the second half of the week, we define identifiability as the condition under which a causal parameter (such as the ATE) can be expressed as a function of the observed data distribution. Students will learn to utilize d-separation and the back-door criterion as tools to determine when identifiability holds, given the assumptions of no unmeasured confounding and positivity.\nWe will evaluate how each type of statistical model (parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric) impacts identifiability. The week will conclude with a comparative discussion across disciplines—such as epidemiology, economics, and statistics—of the various terminologies and conceptual frameworks used to express identifiability conditions. For example, students will explore the relationship between the stable Unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA), ignorability in econometrics, and conditional exchangeability in epidemiology. This reflection will help students understand how each domain approaches the identifiability problem through its unique perspective.\n\n1.4.1 Lecture 7\nBy the end of this lecture, students should be able to:\n\nDefine how DAGs and SCMs formalize causal assumptions and determine potential outcomes (remember level).\nConstruct a SCM from a DAG using structural equations and endogenous variables (apply level).\nExamine the relationship between SCMs and observed data, identifying which counterfactuals are observed versus unobserved (analyze level).\nDistinguish between parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric statistical models, and their implications for inference (analyze level).\n\nThe above goals can be mapped to the following materials:\n\nRoadmap Step 2 - Counterfactuals & Causal Effects (Lecture 3a - Defining Counterfactuals) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nRoadmap Step 2 - Counterfactuals & Causal Effects (Lecture 3b - Deriving Counterfactuals from the Causal Model) and Lecture 3c (Using Counterfactuals to Define Causal Effects) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nRoadmap Step 3 - Observed Data (Lecture 5a - Specify the observed data & their link to the causal model and Lecture 5b - Causal models & (in)dependence in the observed data) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nRoadmap Step 3 - Observed Data (Lecture 5c - Defining the Statistical Model) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Lecture 8\nBy the end of this lecture, students should be able to:\n\nDetermine whether a causal parameter is identifiable using d-separation and the back-door criterion (evaluate level).\nAssess whether key identifiability conditions—no unmeasured confounding and positivity—hold in study designs (evaluate level).\nCompare how different statistical modelling assumptions (parametric, semi, non-parametric) affect identifiability (understand level).\nBuild a visual map that translates vocabulary across disciplines: SUTVA, ignorability, independence, and exchangeability (create level).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA smooth introduction to identifiability\n\n\n\nChapter 5 - Identification, from Huntington-Klein (2021), offers a smooth introduction to identifiability. It could be used as a pre-reading.\n\n\nThe above goals can be mapped to the following materials:\n\nChapter 3 (Observational Studies) from Hernán (2024). Also, Roadmap Step 4 - Identifiability & Step 5 - Estimation Problem (Lecture 6a - Overview & Intuition for Identifiability and Lecture 6c - The Backdoor Criterion) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nRoadmap Step 4 - Identifiability & Step 5 - Estimation Problem (Lecture 6d - The Positivity Assumption) from Petersen and Balzer (2014).\nChapter 11 (Why Model?) from Hernán (2024)\nSection 4.1.5, from Cunningham (2021), provides a detailed elaboration on SUTVA.
