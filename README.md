This repository contains the final deliverable from one of the working groups of the first edition of the Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS), held in the summer of 2025 at HEC Montréal. CanCOTS is primarily a participant-driven working meeting that follows the format of a curated unconference. In this style of unconference, various working groups focus on priority areas of interest related to educational topics. All groups are expected to produce concrete deliverables addressing these priority areas, which may include exercise banks, curriculum guidelines, sample learning activities, and assessment items. Each working group is led by a leader responsible for overseeing collaborative efforts and shaping the final deliverable.

CanCOTS 2025 began with an initial roundtable discussion that brought all participants together. During this session, each group leader presented their educational topic along with a proposal for the final deliverable. Following these presentations, participants split into smaller working groups based on their interests. During the working group meetings, participants—including the group leaders—discussed and brainstormed ideas to develop the final deliverable. Additionally, a comprehensive list of potential resources was compiled to ensure that the deliverable contains fair and scholarly content.

CanCOTS 2025 featured six different working groups, each focusing on a specific area of interest. One of these groups prioritized **incorporating causal inference into statistics courses**. As a result, the final deliverable for this working group was **a curriculum guideline for developing a fourth-year undergraduate course in Causal Inference**. At the start of the unconference, the specifics of the final deliverable were outlined as follows:

> An overall course curriculum on causal inference (including lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of course content) with two fundamental pillars: experimentation and quasi-experimentation. A stretch goal of this working group would be incorporating data science-flavored topics such as A/B testing.

Nevertheless, during the group meetings, the specifics of the final deliverable were revised to go beyond experimentation and quasi-experimentation to include observational studies. Additionally, the brainstorming sessions focused more on statistical perspectives rather than a data science approach. As a result, the final deliverable included in this repository has the following specifics:

> Our final deliverable is an overall undergraduate course curriculum on causal inference (including a **limited** lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of the course) based on a general causal inference roadmap of eight stages: (1) *research question*, (2) *causal model representing knowledge*, (3) *counterfactuals and causal parameter definition*, (4) *statistical model definition*, (5) *model fitting*, (6) *result interpretation*, (7) *data analysis report*.
