**Dates:** Wednesday and Thusday, June 11 and 12, 2025.

**Collaborators:** [G. Alexi Rodr√≠guez-Arelis](https://alexrod.netlify.app/) (UBC) and [Philippe Boileau](https://pboileau.ca/) (McGill University)

This [website](https://alexrod61.github.io/cancots-2025-causal-inf/) contains the following:

- A motivating first presentation on the topic and theme. It is planned to occur during the morning of Wednesday, June 11th. It includes an argument explaining why the topic is important, an initial list of potential outputs (with the understanding that this list will be expanded upon at the meeting, prioritized, and not all outputs will be feasible), and at least one paper or resource to inform/motivate/inspire the work.
- A second presentation that provides a summary of the progress at the end of the first day and outlines the objectives for the second day.
- A third presentation that takes place during the second day to frame the remaining work and wrap up the day, as well as plan for the work that may largely occur offline during the July and August 2025 time period.
