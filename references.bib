  abstract = {We establish that season of birth is related to educational attainment because of school start age policy and compulsory school attendance laws. Individuals born in the beginning of the year start school at an older age, and can therefore drop out after completing less schooling than individuals born near the end of the year. Roughly 25 percent of potential dropouts remain in school because of compulsory schooling laws. We estimate the impact of compulsory schooling on earnings by using quarter of birth as an instrument for education. The instrumental variables estimate of the return to education is close to the ordinary least squares estimate, suggesting that there is little bias in conventional estimates.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent developments in computer science have substantially advanced the use of observational causal inference under Pearl's structural causal model (SCM) framework. A key tool in the application of SCM is the use of casual diagrams, used to visualize the causal structure of a system or process under study. Here, we show how causal diagrams can be extended to ensure proper study design under quasi-experimental settings, including propensity score analysis, before-after-control-impact studies, regression discontinuity design, and instrumental variables. Causal diagrams represent a unified approach to variable selection across methodologies and should be routinely applied in ecology research with causal implications.},
